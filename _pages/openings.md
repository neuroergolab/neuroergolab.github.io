**About the NeuroErgonomics Lab**: Research in the NeuroErgonomics Lab utilizes theories, methods, and techniques from physiology, biomechanics, neuroscience, engineering, and psychology to better understand, monitor, and augment human health and safety in high-risk environments (emergency response, defense, energy, space explorations).

## Student Intern (Full Stack Software Engineer)

**Position**: Student Intern

**Start Date**: September 2024 (in person)

**Duration**: 1 year

**Location**: NeuroergoLab, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA

We are seeking a motivated and talented EE/CS student intern to join our team at NeuroergoLab, University of Wisconsin-Madison. The intern will assist in developing ecosystem to stream, receive, synchronize, and record neural, physiological, and behavioral data streams acquired from diverse sensor hardware (such as the Apple Watch, Empatica, Oura Ring or similar) and build cross-platform applications. This is an exciting opportunity to work on cutting-edge technology and contribute to the development of a product that helps improve human-technology interactions.

**Key Responsibilities**

- Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team to design and develop cross platform data collection and integration solutions, implement APIs
- Assist in building and enhancing mobile and web applications for PVT assessments and user surveys
- Utilize cloud-based services for data storage, processing, and analysis
- Participate in code reviews, testing, and debugging to ensure high-quality deliverables
- Contribute to technical documentation and user guides

**Preferred Qualifications**

- Currently pursuing a degree in ECE/CS or a related field
- Strong understanding of platform integration and experience with APIs (RESTful/GraphQL)
- Proficiency in programming languages such as Python, C++, JavaScript, or similar
- Experience with web app and mobile app development (iOS/Android)
- Experience with cloud services such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure
- Experience with version control systems like Git/GitHub
- Familiarity with communication protocols such as TCP/IP, Bluetooth, MQTT, HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, and LabStreamingLayer (LSL)
- Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail
- Excellent communication and teamwork abilities



## Postdoctoral Researcher

One postdoc opportunities in human states predictions (e.g., stress, learning, fatigue) and closed-loop technological mitigations in controlled and field environments using wearable neuro/physiological/behavioral sensors with the [NeuroergoLab](https://neuroergolab.org/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

**Position**: Post-doctoral Fellow

**Start Date**: September 2024 (in person)

**Lab**: NeuroErgonomics Lab (Director: Ranjana Mehta, PhD)

The NeuroErgonomics Lab in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Texas A&M University is seeking **one post-doctoral fellows** with strong backgrounds in human factors and ergonomics, cognitive neuroscience, HCI, or neural engineering to lead one of two extramurally funded research projects:

1) Human states predictions (e.g., stress, learning, fatigue) and closed-loop technological mitigations in controlled and field environments using wearable neuro/physiological/behavioral sensors; and

2) Multimodal brain-behavior mappings of human-autonomy teaming across increasing contextual complexities. 

**Qualifications:**

* Interested candidates should have obtained a Ph.D. by the start date **(the position can start in Spring 2024)**.
* Knowledge of human factors theories and assessment methods (performance, physiological, and subjective assessments)
* Knowledge and experience in developing/applying computational techniques to analyze bio-behavioral data (e.g., neural, physiological, movement, or eye tracking)
* Excellent human subjectsâ€™ experimentation skills
* Strong programming skills
* A strong track record of peer-reviewed publications and presentations
* The ideal candidate will have proven talent to work independently with excellent interpersonal, communication, and mentoring skills
