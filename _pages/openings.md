- Excellent communication and teamwork abilities



## Postdoctoral Researcher

One postdoc opportunity in human state predictions (e.g., stress, learning, fatigue) in field environments using wearable neuro/physiological/behavioral sensors with the [NeuroergoLab](https://neuroergolab.org/), Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison.  

**Position**: Post-doctoral Fellow

**Start Date**: September 2024 (in person)

**Lab**: NeuroErgonomics Lab (Director: Ranjana Mehta, PhD)

[NeuroergoLab](https://neuroergolab.org/) is seeking one post-doctoral fellow with a strong background in human factors and ergonomics, psychology, physiology, or CS (HCI) to lead our research portfolio on fatigue risk management in operational settings using wearables, interfaces, and behavior analytics.

**Qualifications:**

* Interested candidates should have obtained a Ph.D. by the start date
* Knowledge of human factors theories and assessment methods (performance, physiological, and subjective assessments)
* Knowledge and experience in developing/applying computational techniques to analyze bio-behavioral data (e.g., neural, physiological, movement, or eye tracking)
* Excellent human subjectsâ€™ experimentation skills
* Strong programming skills
* A strong track record of peer-reviewed publications and presentations
