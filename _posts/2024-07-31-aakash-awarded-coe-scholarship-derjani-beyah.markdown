We are thrilled to announce that <a href="https://nimrobotics.com/">Aakash Yadav</a> from the [Neuroergonomics Lab](https://neuroergolab.org) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA, has been awarded the prestigious Antoinette Derjani-Bayeh Scholarship for the 2024-2025 academic year by the UW-Madison College of Engineering.

The Antoinette Derjani-Bayeh Scholarship is awarded to outstanding students in the field of Human Factors & Ergonomics. It was established in memory of Antoinette "Tony" Derjani-Bayeh, a passionate advocate for women and underrepresented groups in engineering. Tony was known for her belief that the engineering community could solve many of today's societal problems.

Aakash's research focuses on human factors and multi-human-robot teaming. Their work explores how we can effectively integrate robots into society to improve human life and safety. This aligns perfectly with Tony Derjani-Bayeh's vision of using engineering to address societal challenges.

This scholarship not only recognizes Aakash's exceptional academic performance but also provides crucial support for their continued research. It will enable him to further their studies in human-robot interaction and contribute to the field's advancement.
